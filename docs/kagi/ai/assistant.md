# Assistant

Kagi Assistant is a product feature backed by Kagi Search and large language models.

> Kagi Assistant is currently in open beta only available to Ultimate plan members.

## Assistant Modes

### Research

Research assistant uses Kagi search and external sources like Wolfram Alpha, together with an AI model to answer your queries.
This model also allows you to upload a file (up to 8 MB) or provide a URL (article, PDF, video, podcast, etc.) to use as context.
If an image is provided it will be processed using GPT4 Vision.

This mode is available in two variants:

- `Fast`: Kagi search coupled with a fast LLM (`claude-instant`). Optimized for speed, while not sacrificing quality. Access directly with the `!fast` bang.
- `Expert`: Multiple Kagi searches (and external services) together with the best available LLM (`claude-2`) for the highest accuracy and comprehensive responses. Access directly with the `!expert` bang.

Research Assistant supports using [Lenses](../features/lenses.md) to filter the types of websites used as context to generate an answer. Lenses are predefined categories that help you focus on specific topics or sources. This allows you to restrict results to more trustworthy or relevant sites for your needs. To enable this feature, toggle the Lenses switch and select one of the available options.
